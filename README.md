Bob is a high-level build system that isolates pipelines from the host system by executing them in a sandboxed shell to run them anywhere - [Nix Insideâ„¢](https://nixos.org/).

Why is this useful?

* Get rid of "Works on My Machine".
* No more building in docker.
* Easily jump between different versions of a programming language.


## Vision
Write Once, Build Once, Anywhere.

**Designed to relieve the pain from microservice development.**
## Getting Started

Documentation is available at [bob.build](https://bob.build/docs)

## Install

[docs-installation](https://bob.build/docs/getting-started/installation)

If you wanna go wild and have Go 1.17 or later installed, the short version is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/benchkram/bob
cd bob
go install
```

For shell autocompletion (bash and zsh supported) add `source <(bob completion)` to your `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`.

### How it works
Bobs generates its internal build graph from tasks described in a `bob.yaml` file (usually refered to as "Bobfile").
Each build step is executed in a sandbox shell only using the given dependecies required from the nix package manager.

The basic components of a build task are:

- **input**: Whenever an input changes, the task's commands need to be re-executed.
- **cmd**: Commands to be executed
- **target**: File(s) or directories that are created, cached locally.
- **dependencies** Dependencies managed by the Nix package manager

Example of a `bob.yaml` file:

```yaml
build:
  build:
    input: "*"
    cmd: |
      go build -o ./app
    target: ./app
    dependencies: [ git, go_1_18 ]
```

Multiline `sh` and `bash` commands are entirely possible, powered by [mvdan/sh](https://github.com/mvdan/sh).
